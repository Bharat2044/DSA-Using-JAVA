/*
Problem Description:
You are given the Cost Price C and Selling Price S of a Product. You have to tell whether there is a Profit or Loss. Also, calculate total profit or loss.

NOTE: It is guaranteed that Cost Price and Selling Price are not equal.

Problem Constraints:
1 <= C, S <= 109
C â‰  S

Input Format:
First line of the input contains a single integer C.
Second line of the input contains a single integer S.

Output Format:
Print two integers in separate lines.
First integer denotes whether there is a profit or loss. If there is a profit, print 1, else print -1.
Second integer is a non-negative integer denoting the absolute value of total profit or loss.

Example Input:
Input 1:
2 4
Input 2:
4 1

Example Output:
Output 1:
1 2
Output 2:
-1 3

Example Explanation:
Explanation 1:
Cost Price = 2 Selling Price = 4 As Cost Price < Selling Price, there is a profit. Total Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 4 - 2 = 2
Explanation 2:
Cost Price = 4 Selling Price = 1 As Cost Price > Selling Price, there is a loss. Total Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price = 4 - 1 = 3
